Educational tutorials for speech and language processing classes

This repository contains materials that can be utilized in in-class tutorials for speech and language processing classes.
The original material in this repository comes from CSE 5525: Foundations of Speech & Language Processing at The Ohio State University.

The material in this repository is geared towards advanced undergraduates and graduate students.  Many of the tutorials assume a
programming background, and at least a passing familiarity with python.

A virtual machine is used to house the resources; this VM can be built using Vagrant.  After installing vagrant, issuing “vagrant up” in the directory where the Vagrantfile is will create a new VM with all of the materials.
