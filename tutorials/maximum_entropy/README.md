# Maximum Entropy tutorial

This lab was developed as an exercise for OSU CSE 5525: Foundations of Speech and Language Processing.  The main goal of this lab is to get students thinking about how a MaxEnt model is learned (i.e. thinking about the optimization process).  To that end, it uses the General Iterative Scaling algorithm, which is not a great algorithm overall, but has the wonderful attribute of appearing to be complex but ending up being rather simple and intuitive when you work through what's going on.  Students first generate a biased training set, and then implement the algorithm given in the tutorial.  Allowing them to compare the results of the learned model against the "truth" can help drive the learning

Software requirements
=====================
* python (should be installed in VM)

Data requirements
=================
* None (self contained)

How to get started
==================
* See maxent_tutorial.pdf to get started

TO DO
=====

NOTES
===== 
Requires some familiarity with python to follow the exact steps, but
students should be able to code the algorithm in other languages if
they wish.
