the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place 
the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted 
the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr 
 only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city 
the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous 
it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them 
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments 
merger proposed 
however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration 
the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies 
it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem 
implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury 
it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected 
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes 
 this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money 
the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties 
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said 
 failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers 
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation 
wards protected 
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee 
 these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said 
regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences 
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable 
ask jail deputies 
on other matters the jury recommended that 
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail 
 
fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes 
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioners office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department

georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the governors race a top official said wednesday 
robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience 
state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker 
in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters 
despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended 
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents 
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken 
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or 
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform

the georgia legislature will wind up its session monday and head for home where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly 
before adjournment monday afternoon the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made 
gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment 
vandiver likely will mention the million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item 
construction bonds 
meanwhile it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first million worth of highway reconstruction bonds 
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgias most heavily traveled highways 
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some million to million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work 
a revolving fund 
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities 
vandiver opened his race for governor in with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin 
the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds 
schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the bodys action of friday in voting itself a per day increase in expense allowances 
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought

but he added that none of georgias congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution 
the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday 
it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises

the new school superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee

 committee approval of gov price daniels abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers 
daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation 
under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week 
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it 
daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug 
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic 
it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more 
the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer 
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared 
dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers 
 if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said 
 you take out of circulation many millions of dollars 
rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies 
his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin 
cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts 
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday 
austin texas

it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of or more population require deaf children between and years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here 
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be which would be a savings of yearly after the first years capital outlay of was absorbed parkhouse told the senate 
the tea estimated there would be scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school 
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e red berry and joe ratcliff 
while details are still to be worked out ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berrys proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected 
 were getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff 
 but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also 
im willing to stake my political career on it 
rep berry an exgambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies 
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later 
the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health departments authority to give planning assistance to cities 
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar 
one validated acts of school districts 
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district 
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted 
without dissent senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district 
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site 
two tax revision bills were passed 
one by sen louis crump of san saba would aid more than retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized 
instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a fine 
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league 
the other bill by sen a m aikin jr of paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds 
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by sen frank owen of el paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas 
marshall formby of plainview former chairman of the texas highway commission suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress eliminating the need for costly special elections 
under formbys plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the house attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court 
austin texas 
 state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay 
an adverse vote of to kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april ballot when texas votes on a us senator 
rep wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill 
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb 
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by twothirds majorities before march to be printed on the april ballot roberts said 
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldnt give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice 
all dallas members voted with roberts except rep bill jones who was absent 
austin texas 
 paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday 
rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of people 
when the shouting ended the bill passed to sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas 
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse 
the bill would increase from to the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project 
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas 
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway cottens attack 
the bills defenders were mostly smalltown legislators like j w buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs 
 this is a poor boys bill said chapman 
 dallas and fort worth can vote bonds 
this would help the little peanut districts

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program 
the report culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm listed long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load 
the report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and adc dependency 
 must solve problem 
the monthly cost of adc to more than recipients in the county is million dollars said c virgil martin president of carson pirie scott co committee chairman 
 we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence martin said 
the volume of adc cases will decrease martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color 
these he said are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc 
calls for extension 
other recommendations made by the committee are 
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity 
research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy 
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest judge james b parsons was told in criminal court yesterday 
the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial 
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements a separate trial 
bellows made the request while the allwoman jury was out of the courtroom 
fears prejudicial aspects 
 the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court 
 some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property 
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others 
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this 
 yes your honor replied bellows 
 what this amounts to if true is that there will be a freeforall fight in this case 
there is a conflict among the defendants 
washington july 
 president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio 
the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone 
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion 
decisions are made 
asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say its got to go thru several more drafts 
salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city 
the last cases in the investigation of the nov election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means 
karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the persons 
he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens 
karns ruling pertained to eight of the cases 
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case 
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against persons in precincts by morris j wexler special prosecutor 
issue jury subpoenas 
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury 
mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the th precinct of the d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation 
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning 
karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room 
he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes 
 actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court 
faced seven cases 
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving persons 
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another 
the cases involved judges in the d th and d precincts of the st ward the st and th precincts of the th ward the th precinct of the th ward and the th precinct of the d ward 
the case of the judges in the th precinct of the d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns 
two other cases also were under advisement 
claims precedent lacking 
after reading his statement discharging the d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them 
washington feb 
 president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of million americans over who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs 
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build new medical and new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research 
the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill 
it was defeated in congress last year 
cost up to a year 
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes 
the social security payroll tax is now per cent per cent on each worker and employer on the first of pay per year 
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to a year and the payroll tax to per cent per cent each 
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system 
the payroll tax would actually rise to per cent starting jan if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs 
outlays would increase 
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run billion or more in the first year 
both figures would go higher in later years 
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of million to billion dollars over the next years 
these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes 
nursing home care 
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to days for each illness except that the patient would pay a day of the cost for the first nine days 
 
full payment of nursing home bills for up to days following discharge from a hospital 
a patient could receive up to days paidfor nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit 
 
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of a patient 
 
community visiting nurse services at home for up to days an illness 
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged 
calls proposal modest 
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay 
 this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals 
 this is not a program of socialized medicine 
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed 
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital 
wouldnt pay doctors 
the plan does not cover doctor bills 
they would still be paid by the patient 
apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools 
the president said the nations medical and dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care 
moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs 
contributions to schools 
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to a year for onefourth of the first year students 
the schools could use the money to pay year scholarships based on need of up to a year per student 
in addition the government would pay a cost of education grant to the schools for each in scholarship grants 
officials estimated the combined programs would cost million dollars the first year and would go up to millions by 
the president recommended federal matching grants totaling million dollars in years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones 
more for nursing homes 
in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction 
he asked for another million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes 
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals 
in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the childrens bureau 
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute 
asks research funds 
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation 
he did not say by how much 
for medical research he asked a million dollar a year increase from to millions in matching grants for building research facilities 
the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the million dollars in the budget for direct government research in medicine 
the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them 
reaction as expected 
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines 
legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan 
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message 
senate republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance 
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first 
house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house 
washington feb 
 acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nations federal housing chief 
only senators were on the floor and there was no record vote 
a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard 
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency 
in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a hour delay after they are reported to the floor 
enforce by demand 
the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in and president kennedys in 
oslo 
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings 
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes 
in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems 
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems 
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence 
explosion avoided 
in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension 
the general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council 
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance 
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive 
even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line 
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for 
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive 
but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy 
exploratory mood 
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited 
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots 
the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months 
but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters 
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole 
conflict surveyed 
the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that eastwest friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection 
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent 
this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come 
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled 
washington 
the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time 
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos 
the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam 
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this 
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated 
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility 
policies modified 
the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference 
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make 
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration 
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas 
but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises 
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression 
former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union 
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory 
gop restrained 
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it 
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba 
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score 
his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now 
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first 
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination 
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators 
detente urged 
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups 
it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations 
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds 
mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation 
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated 
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors 
aid plans revamped 
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration 
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements 
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed 
but thus far there has been no response in kind 
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations 
in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture 
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos 
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate 
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization 
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos 
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos 
 some seato nations disagreed however 
 
there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam 
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos 
the prowestern government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army 
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt 
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them 
one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
he declared on march that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna 
washington 
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states 
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation 
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems 
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend 
offenses multiply 
the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem 
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett a special assistant to the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime 
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since each year showing an increase in offenders 
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under years of age 
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director raymond h hawksley the present city cd head believes 
mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time 
east providence now has no civil defense program 
mr hawksley the states general treasurer has been a parttime cd director in the city for the last nine years 
he is not interested in being named a fulltime director 
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director 
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs 
mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job 
one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said 
along with a director the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized 
mr hawksley said 
one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program 
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said 
mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station 
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area 
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack 
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point he said and a drivein theater in seekonk would be another 
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point 
mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack 
such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know 
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally 
one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid 
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government 
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind 
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly 
the governors move into the socalled blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant deputy city clerk of central falls 
a copy was released to the press 
mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july and sent to the state house by miss grant 
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature 
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review mr notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty gen j joseph nugent to get the benefit of his views 
he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation the governor said 
 i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws 
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales 
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws 
should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation 
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws 
the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath 
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday 
the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday the councils resolution said 
the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors 
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government 
the council advised the governor that large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on sunday 
they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community 
liberals and conservatives in both parties democratic and republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george h reama nationally known labormanagement expert said here yesterday 
mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheratonbiltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system 
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day 
he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 
that he added was when he was a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade 
 that was before i studied law 
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party 
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track 
he steered me to the right track the free enterprise track 
he said that when he was a socialist in the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources 
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties 
mr reama who retired as vice president of the american screw co in said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product but neither told us how to achieve it 
he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added 
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own 
mr reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling 
a petition bearing the signatures of more than johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town 
william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr 
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within days and mr martinelli happens to hold that post 
mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within days 
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within days after the board of canvassers completes its work 
a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled 
mr martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead 
mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures 
he assured mr martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible 
mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july to plan further strategy in the charter movement 
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes 
 after inspiring this i think we should certainly follow through on it he declared 
 it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement 
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission 
 our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement he indicated and to tell them what this will mean for the town 
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september 
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter 
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated 
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses 
several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system 
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at mondays special north providence town council meeting 
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance 
at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective 
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation 
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition 
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense 
plainfield 
 james p mitchell and sen walter h jones rbergen last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j hughes democratic gubernatorial candidate that the gop is campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism 
mitchell was for using it jones against and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before persons at the park hotel 
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club 
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of womens clubs 
hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired 
now hes gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state 
sunday he had added we can love eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership 
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign 
 how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this 
he asked 
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration 
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue 
regrets attack 
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president 
 he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign he said because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into rearguing an old national campaign 
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark 
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary 
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign 
state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry 
decries joblessness 
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate must share the blame for this 
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform 
 but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said 
jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell 
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises 
 he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you cant have it both ways jones said 
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue 
defends ike 
earlier mitchell said in a statement 
 i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j hughes 
his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations 
 i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste 
 such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature 
it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit 
sees jones ahead 
sen charles w sandman rcape may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination 
sandman state campaign chairman for jones was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel newark of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones 
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years 
sandman said the announcement that sen clifford case aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway 
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jerseys problems 
 we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington 
that failed 
 we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year 
that too will fail 
sandman announced the appointment of mrs harriet copeland greenfield of woodland ave westfield as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee 
mrs greenfield is president of the westfield womens republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman 
county supervisor weldon r sheets who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them 
the proposal sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a lip service word 
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a year period without interest or charge 
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january 
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines 
the candidacy of mayor james j sheeran of west orange for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county was supported today by edward w roos west orange public safety commissioner 
sheeran a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organizations candidate freeholder william macdonald for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy now a member of the state board of tax appeals 
 my experience as public safety commissioner roos said has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer 
jim sheeran fits that description 
trenton 
 william j seidel state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development has retired after years of service 
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state 
seidel joined the department in as a division fire warden after graduation in from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies 
in october he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section 
under his supervision the state firefighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting 
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station 
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens 
he is credited with setting up an annual cooperative fire prevention program in cooperation with the red cross and state department of education 
boonton 
 richard j hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state 
he promised nearly democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn when i come back here after the november election youll think youre my man youre the kind of governor were glad we elected 
he said we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time 
attacks republicans 
in his only attack on the republicans hughes said the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary 
but well have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform 
well not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson 
 well take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november 
he said you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration 
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead 
he urged new jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy 
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry 
 we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said 
 to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early s 
calling the democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people hughes asked a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november 
hughes supported gov meyners green acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development 
he said legislation for a million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday 
conservation plan 
the plan will provide million for purchase of open land by the state 
the other million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis 
hughes said this is not a plan to conquer space but to conserve it pointing out the state population has increased each year since 
he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve 
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved 
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans 
 after the primary he promised ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration 
im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee 
trenton 
 fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring voluntarily this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues 
the outgoing members whose fouryear terms will expire a week after the april primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by 
there may be other state committee retirements come april but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters 
a special presentation was made to mrs geraldine thompson of red bank who is stepping down after years on the committee 
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early s following adoption of the womens suffrage amendment 
she served one fouryear term on the national committee 
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r screvane and abraham d beame as running mates 
at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable 
some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years 
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayors efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders 
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party 
opposition reported 
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept democratic primary 
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city 
their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor 
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph t sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader 
mayor visits buckley 
as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio the manhattan leader 
he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party 
last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation 
apparently he believes mr buckley holds the key to the democratic organizations acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle 
in talks with mr buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa who lives in the bronx from this years ticket 
but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor 
screvane and beame hailed 
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane who lives in queens to replace abe stark the incumbent as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame who lives in brooklyn to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller 
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx 
after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterdays new york times 
the mayor said 
 it didnt come from me 
but as i have said before if i announce my candidacy i will have something definite to say about running mates 
boston june 
 a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts 
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics 
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same 
 its see joe see jim he says 
 the hand is out 
a political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control 
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them 
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin oconnors novel the last hurrah 
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject 
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year 
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations 
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state 
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in massachusetts public life 
day after day some new episode is reported 
the state public works department is accused of having spent to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property 
an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate 
washington june 
 congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers 
in the senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition 
in the house the southernrepublican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administrations housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aidtoeducation bill 
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee 
it is expected to be reported out tuesday but this is a little uncertain 
the panels action depends on the return of representative james w trimble democrat of arkansas who has been siding with speaker sam rayburns forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor 
mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday 
leadership is hopeful 
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans 
the democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week 
the measure which was passed last monday by the senate provides for fortyyear mortgages at low downpayments for moderateincome families 
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories 
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy 
they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts 
three groups to meet 
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 
this would provide for longterm federal loans for construction of parochial and other privateschool facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics 
mr delaney and mr oneill are not willing to vote on the publicschool measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee 
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps 
in the budget that has been submitted for congressional approval would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies 
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contractnegotiation stage gordon boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a washington interview 
six of these were proposed by religious groups 
they will be for teaching agriculture and community development in southeast asia africa the middle east and latin america 
question raised 
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals 
there are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example 
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled 
when he protested the hotel owner said 
 why do you worry 
the u s government is paying for it 
the u s government pays for all its overseas workers 
missionary explains 
 i dont work for the government the american said 
 im a missionary 
the hotel owner shrugged 
 same thing he said 
and then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical churchstate problem 
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state 
r sargent shriver jr director of the corps is certain that they can 
no religious group he declared in an interview will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes 
moscow june 
 at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said beaming look he took everything i had 
mr khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker 
indonesia is one of the twenty underdeveloped countries of asia africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid 
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations 
the communist countries allocated more than in economic aid alone last year according to western estimates 
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the underdeveloped countries made its modest beginning in 
in more than communist technicians were present in those countries 
united nations n y june 
 a committee of experts has recommended that a countrys population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations 
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations 
one effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india 
india is the most populous united nations member with more than inhabitants 
the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report

 thousands of bleachertype seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan 
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f kennedy and retiring president dwight d eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oathtaking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route 
pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint 
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it 
many buildings 
within view of the avenue are some of the united states governments tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments 
of course pennsylvania the white house is the most famous address of the free world 
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about sevenstories high 
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about years old 
in the early spring of a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch women parade 
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote 
in the presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time 
seats on square 
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this countrys most valuable records are kept 
also the department of justice building is located where j edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation 
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground 
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square opposite the white house 
in this historic square are several statues but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans 
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least marching units 
about military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade 
division one of the parade will be the service academies 
division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas the respective states of the president and of vicepresident l b johnson 
then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union 
division three will be headed by the marines followed by states 
division four will be headed by the navy followed by states 
division five by the air force followed by states 
division six will be headed by the coast guard followed by the reserve forces of all services five states puerto rico the virgin islands guam american samoa the trust territories and the canal zone

 what does offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi 
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the states immediate political future 
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants gov ross barnett 
barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well 
consequently it is uncertain after nearly months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year 
could be scramble 
some predict the administration will settle down during and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far 
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office 
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble 
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the legislative session 
if barnett doesnt call a special session in it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session 
the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year 
districts issue 
legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the per diem is not certain and if they start agitating 
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure 
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the states congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat 
with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature 
mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house 
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck 
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together 
future clouded 
barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary 
with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election 
now the picture is clouded and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status 
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen 
baton rouge la 
 the gov jimmie h davis administration appears to face a difficult year in with the governors theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses 
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue 
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government 
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from per cent to per cent 
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program 
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation 
legislators weary 
indeed the administrations curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat 
the administration could not say why million was needed for a grantinaid program 
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote 
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes 
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy 
if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration 
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature 
actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway 
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration 
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly 
they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual 
underlying concern 
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition 
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle 
then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period 
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one 
but if the administration should find it does not need the million for a grantinaid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes 
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash 
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year 
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma 
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues 
constant problem 
in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser 
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor 
it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem 
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature 
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year 
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize 
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves 
the new year might see some housecleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms 
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city 
estimates of the citys loss in the job have ranged as high as 
shortcuts unnoticed

travelers indemnity co and the continental casualty co 
at bergers direction the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u s district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there 
 i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated berger said 
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track 
the contract called for overhauling of joints 
the city paid for work on of which no more than were repaired hemphill charged 
wide range in bids 
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of for each joint 
the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass which listed the same officers as hughes was per joint 
but hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from to per joint 
bergers decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference 
wagner said the city paid only to the hughes company 
 we wont know the full amount until we get a full report wagner said 
 we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond berger said 
wagner replied cant you just see the headline city hooked for 
 know enough to sue 
berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount 
douglas m pratt president of the ptc who attended the meeting said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el 
 we want to find out who knew about it pratt said 
 certain people must have known about it 
 the ptc is investigating the whole matter pratt said

ankara turkey oct ap 
 turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen cemal gursel as president 
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct was reached after almost hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup detat 
bypassing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes months ago the army general staff led by gen cedvet sunay had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government 
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen gursel as president 
gen gursel has headed the military junta the last months 
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned 
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own

helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically e m martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night 
martin who has been in office in washington d c for months spoke at the councils annual meeting at the multnomah hotel 
he told some persons that the united states challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths 
 we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty 
patience needed 
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the soviet union 
he cited east germany where after years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added so long as people rebel we must not give up 
martin called for patience on the part of americans 
 the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build he said 
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said 
individual help best 
 we have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient the assistant secretary said 
economically martin said the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves 
private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves 
the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a social cost 
martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country 
the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portlands civil defense more plans for the citys schools in event of attack 
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow 
the board members after hearing the coordination plea from mrs ralph h molvar sw maplecrest dr said they thought they had already been cooperating 
chairman c richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go 
dr melvin w barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district 
 los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster he said 
 nobody really expects to evacuate 
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following 
mrs molvar who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand said we must have faith in somebody on the local level and it wouldnt be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children 
dr barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work 
mrs molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowes program 
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting 
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be done

however the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list 
the first of beliefs of the denomination now reads
