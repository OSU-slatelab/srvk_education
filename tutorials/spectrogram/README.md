# Radio Rex / Spectrogram lab

This lab was developed as an exercise for OSU CSE 5525: Foundations of Speech and Language Processing.  The primary idea of this tutorial is to get experience in frequency analysis, with the twin goals of developing their own spectogram code as well as thinking about how one could implement Radio Rex (the first speech recognizer).  See the description of Radio Rex in Jurafsky & Martin, or perform an internet search for "Radio Rex".

Software requirements
=====================
* Octave (should be installed in VM) or MATLAB
* Sox (should be installed in VM) to play examples from octave.

Data requirements
=================
* rexdata: a directory of recordings including the word "Rex" (in this directory)

How to get started
==================
* See the RadioRex_spectrogram.pdf file for the tutorial.
* New_to_matlab.pdf may be useful for students who have no experience with MATLAB/octave.

TO DO
=====
* Create a version of this tutorial using python/ipython notebook

NOTES
=====
Octave does not always fully implement everything in MATLAB.  Sound support can be a bit sketchy.  I have only tested sound support within the VM using a Mac host.
